INTRO - 
	"You enter the dank, humid cave on your journey into the unknown.
	Hunting for the lost treasure of Asmongold, this cave was the last
	place on your map that you hadn't checked yet. Hopefully somewhere
	deep within these ruins is what you seek."
	
	"You walk deeper through the entrance and the light is starting to
	dim as the cave opening disappers behind you."
